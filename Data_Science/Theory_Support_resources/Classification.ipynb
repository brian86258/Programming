    "## What is classification? Which models would you use to solve a classification problem?   \n",
    "Classification problems are problems in which our prediction space is discrete, i.e. there is a finite number of values the output variable can be.  \n",
    "Models that can be used to solve classification problems: **logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, Neural Network,...**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logistic regression? When do we need to use it?\n",
    "Logistic regression is a Machine Learning algorithm that is used for **binary classification.** You should use **logistic regression when your Y variable takes only two values**, e.g. True and False, \"spam\" and \"not spam\", \"churn\" and \"not churn\" and so on. The variable is said to be a \"binary\" or \"dichotomous\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Is logistic regression a linear model? Why? \n",
    "Yes, Logistic Regression is considered a **generalized linear model** because the **outcome** always **depends on the sum of the inputs and parameters**. Or in other words, the output cannot depend on the product (or quotient, etc.) of its parameters.\n",

    "## What is sigmoid? What does it do? \n",
    "A sigmoid function is a type of activation function, and more specifically defined as squashing function. Squashing functions limit the output to a range between 0 and 1, making these functions useful in the prediction of probabilities.  \n",
    "$Sigmoid(x) = \\frac{1}{(1+e^{-x})}$\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "## How do we evaluate classification models?\n",
    "Depending on the classification problem, we can use the following evaluation metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accuracy\n",
    "1. Precision\n",
    "1. Recall\n",
    "1. F1 Score\n",
    "1. Logistic loss (also known as Cross-entropy loss)\n",
    "1. Jaccard similarity coefficient score\n",

    "## Terminology:\n",
    "* Cost function = Loss function = Error function: A cost function is a **measure of error** between what value your model **predicts** and what the **value actually is**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost functions for Regression problems:\n",
    "Mean Error (ME), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Categorical Cross Entropy Cost Function, Binary Cross Entropy Cost Function.\n",
    "* Activation function(Threshold function): Used to find the discrete and non-linear output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Common activation function: ReLu, sigmoid, Hyperbolic tangent function\n"
